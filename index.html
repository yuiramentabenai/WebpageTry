And here is a picture of the cat that I am fosteringâ†‘

</p>

<p>
To make friend with a cat, fisrt you need to knee on the floor and gently let them sniff your hand. Watch their body language.
Slow blink is suggested.

</p>

<p>
As an international student, I can't be constantly having a pet, but I could offer help by having these cute animals staying at a home for a fairly long time! Our cat has gained weight from 9.8 pounds to 10.25 pounds! It is said that he refused to eat at the shelter but he has been eating a lot at our place. I hope anyone has the same thought can realize they have a chance to help!
</p>

Here is a link to the shelter's foster page:<a href="https://anticruelty.org/become-foster" class="nav2">Become a foster</a>.
